// ISSUE: if you log the first  array to the console, you'll see that when we  
// pushed the fourth element into the 2nd array,  it was also pushed into the first array.
// This is because the second array is  not actually a copy of the first,  
// it's a new variable which points to the same  object as the other variable. Because of this,  
// anything we do to the second array will  be done to the first and vice versa. 
// Vanilla JavaScript has ways to resolve  this issue, but since weâ€™re learning ES6,

//If we want to chnage just one value from orignal object we do the following
let obj3 = {...obj1,b:9}
console.log('Orginal obj1 is untouched but new obj3 had obj1 values plus updated b from 2 to 9 ->',obj3)

console.log('-------------- Copying only part of an array/object -----------------')

console.log(arr5)
