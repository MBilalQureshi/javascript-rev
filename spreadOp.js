// ISSUE: if you log the first  array to the console, you'll see that when we  
// pushed the fourth element into the 2nd array,  it was also pushed into the first array.
// This is because the second array is  not actually a copy of the first,  
// it's a new variable which points to the same  object as the other variable. Because of this,  
// anything we do to the second array will  be done to the first and vice versa. 
// Vanilla JavaScript has ways to resolve  this issue, but since weâ€™re learning ES6,

// Create a variable named subjects using the keyword let
// Assign it a copy of the subjects array from the first object in the students array
// Create a variable named update using the keyword const
// Assign the variable update a single line arrow function  (should not have a return statement)
// The arrow function should take two parameters named: item and val the arrow function should copy the array passed in and add the value passed to it, then return the array.
// Create a variable named: updatedSubjects using the keyword let
// Variable updatedSubjects should be assigned the return value from calling the update function passing in the subjects array and the string "Electronics"
// Variable updatedSubjects should have the correct value
// The original version of the subjects array in the students array should not have been modified
// log out the variable updatedSubjects to see its value
